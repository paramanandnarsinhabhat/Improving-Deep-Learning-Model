# Emergency Vehicle Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify images as either featuring an emergency vehicle or not. The model is trained using a dataset of images and corresponding labels.

## 1. Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, which includes image names and emergency vehicle classification labels (0 or 1). Images are read into a numpy array for further processing.

## 2. Pre-processing the Data
Images are reshaped from 3D to 1D arrays to be suitable for input into a neural network. Pixel values are normalized to fall between 0 and 1.

## 3. Creating Training and Validation Set
The dataset is split into training and validation sets with a 70-30 ratio using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.

## 4. Defining the Model Architecture
The model is a simple feedforward neural network with `Dense` layers using the sigmoid activation function. The output layer has one unit with a sigmoid activation suitable for binary classification.

## 6. Setting Up Early Stopping
Early Stopping is used during training to halt the training process if the validation loss does not improve by at least 0.01 for 5 consecutive epochs, to prevent overfitting.

## 7. Training the Model Using Early Stopping
The model is trained for up to 100 epochs with the specified Early Stopping criteria.

## Hyperparameter Tuning for Early Stopping
The patience value for Early Stopping is increased to observe the impact on model training and performance.

## Results
After training, the model's accuracy on the validation set is printed, and a plot of the training and validation loss over epochs is displayed to assess the model's performance visually.

## Instructions for Use
1. Install the required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `keras`, and `sklearn`.
2. Load your dataset in the same format as `emergency_classification.csv`.
3. Run the script to train the model and evaluate its performance on the validation set.

## Notes
- Ensure that the images folder is correctly referenced relative to the script's directory.
- Adjust the Early Stopping parameters based on the desired training behavior.
